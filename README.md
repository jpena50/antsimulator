# antsimulator

Just a test of what I can do currently and a way to teach myself C++.

I want to add to my portfolio and what better way than to simulate ant movements.

Those peculiar little creatures have an interesting ability to find food.

First I will start off with one ant then progress to a colony and eventually add their pheromone trails.

This setup requires SFML the simple fast media library. https://www.sfml-dev.org/
